# AMBU-LIFE-SAVIER
Problem Statement:- Ambulance delay causes life risks.

Solution:- As we know the main issue of India is traffic problem which causes many other problems like ambulance delay. More than 30% of patients die and many peopleâ€™s life is in risk  on their way to hospital because of the delay caused by  traffic jam.

   Our  system aims to improve the ambulance facilities using IOT (internet of things), computer vision and android in which ambulance sends the path details to the control room through android app which they want to cover the path to the hospital. So they can analyse the density of the traffic in respective path of the ambulance and contact to traffic police officer to clear that path. And if it is not possible to do this then they inform alternate path to the ambulance where the traffic density is less .We make an IOT based traffic density system using raspberrypi  which gives the density of vehicles or the alternative path to our android app.
       
   Sometimes the traffic covers more than one kilometre due to which siren horn also fails to aware other people. So we use V2V(vehicle to vehicle) Communication in which ambulance communicate with other vehicles to clear the road in the range of 500 - 800m due to which everyone get aware and clear the path if possible.
